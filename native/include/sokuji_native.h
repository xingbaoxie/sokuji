/* sokuji-native — the one C ABI the sidecar talks to.
 * Conventions: opaque handles; every call returns sk_status (0 ok, negative error) and
 * sk_last_error() carries a thread-local UTF-8 message; callbacks take a void *user and
 * return bool — false cancels; threads are configured once in sk_init(). Prefixes name
 * the stage (sk_asr_, sk_translate_, sk_tts_), never the engine behind it.
 *
 * Three rules that hold for every call in this header, now and in later slices:
 *   - Nothing works before sk_init() succeeds. Any call that needs a live library
 *     returns SK_ERR_NOT_INITIALISED and sets sk_last_error(); the exceptions are the
 *     pure accessors below (sk_abi_version, sk_version, sk_engine_versions,
 *     sk_last_error, sk_free, and sk_audio_families — compile-time data, no backend
 *     needed) and sk_devices(), which reports 0 devices.
 *   - sk_init() is idempotent, and only the FIRST successful call decides the log sink
 *     and the thread count: a later sk_init() with a different sk_init_options.log
 *     returns SK_OK and changes nothing. The caller must keep that first callback (and
 *     its log_user) alive for the life of the process.
 *   - Strings and buffers this library hands back through an out-parameter are
 *     malloc-allocated and owned by the caller, who releases each one with sk_free().
 *     Pointers RETURNED directly (sk_version, sk_last_error, sk_engine_versions, the
 *     sk_audio_families entries) are static or thread-local storage: never freed. */
