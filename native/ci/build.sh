# CPU-only build/record tree (SOKUJI_GPU=none) regardless of this script's own LANE: the

# on a real GPU (tests/test_ops_coverage.cpp's F2 note, spec A §3.2's host=1 rule — audio.cpp
# builds a different graph on a host backend) and are checked on the fleet via a

# SK_TEST_TTS_SUPERTONIC_DIR once any model is present (rc 1, not a skip — the clone-only
# families' reference clip comes from it), and the variable doubles as the "is the test cache
# populated at all" probe, so an unset one means the whole tree would be built to prove nothing.
# SOKUJI_BUILD_RECORD=0 forces it off even when the models are present.
