/* EXACT layout of one recorded tensor, replacing the old single "contiguous?" bool.
 *
 * Fix round 2 (F1): one bool cannot distinguish the two ways a tensor is non-contiguous, and
 * the backends check predicates that tell them apart. A PERMUTE that keeps ne[0] innermost
 * (`ggml_permute(x,0,2,1,3)`) leaves rows contiguous; a TRANSPOSE does not. Modelling every
 * non-contiguous source as a transpose refused irodori_tts's ROPE on Vulkan
 * (ggml-vulkan wants `ggml_is_contiguous_rows(src0)`) although the real graph satisfies it.
 *
 * `perm` is the axis order by ASCENDING stride — perm[k] is the axis with the k-th smallest
 * nb. {0,1,2,3} is ggml's natural order; {1,0,2,3} is a transpose; {0,2,1,3} is a
 * row-contiguous permute. `dense` says nb equals the packed layout under that permutation
 * (nb[perm[k]] = type_size × ∏ ne[perm[j<k]], the first factor divided by the block size), so
 * a dense tensor is fully described by perm + ne and is rebuilt by permuting a packed base.
 * A STRIDED tensor (a view into something larger) additionally carries its `nb` and is rebuilt
 * with ggml_view_4d on a base big enough to hold it — never grown, since the strides are the
 * thing being modelled. */
