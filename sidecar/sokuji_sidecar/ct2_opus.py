"""Opus-MT translation via CTranslate2 (int8, CPU).

Replaces the former Marian ONNX numpy decode loop (~11x slower; also had the
ignored-bad_words_ids empty-output bug). Model dirs mirror the
gaudi/opus-mt-*-ctranslate2 layout: config.json, model.bin,
shared_vocabulary.json, source.spm, target.spm.

These conversions ship add_source_eos=false, so the source token sequence
must end with an explicit </s> — omitting it degenerates into repetition
loops. Source length is capped at 510 pieces (+eos) to stay under Marian's
512 positional-embedding limit."""
