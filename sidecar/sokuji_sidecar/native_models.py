"""Model download/status registry for the LOCAL_NATIVE provider.

Each native model id maps to a set of HuggingFace repos (+ the VAD url). status
checks they're fully cached; download fetches them file-by-file with progress.
Mirrors LOCAL_INFERENCE's manage-before-use UX, but server-side (HF cache).

The silero VAD (silero_vad.onnx) is a shared runtime dependency of EVERY ASR
model: AsrEngine._init_vad() loads it for both the offline and streaming paths,
independent of which recognizer runs. So download_specs() appends it for any
ASR-catalog model (not just SenseVoice), guaranteeing a single-model offline
install is self-sufficient. It's a 643KB global singleton at sokuji-vad/, so
delete_model() never removes it — another installed model may still need it.

    WITHOUT an override, a multi-quant card's file requirement is satisfied by
    ANY cached rung of its ladder (see _ladder_artifacts) — the override form
    keeps per-quant semantics for the download buttons.

    A multi-variant TTS card (qwen3-tts's self-contained fp32/bf16 repos —
    see catalog.py) applies the analogous any-rung relaxation, but per-repo
    rather than per-file: WITHOUT an override, the card is 'ready' when ANY
    of its unique deployment-artifact repos is fully cached, since load-time
    resolution (accel.resolve_tts) only ever picks a downloaded variant. This
    branch only checks repos — it intentionally skips the urls/files checks
    below (fine today, since no any-rung TTS card carries either; a future
    multi-variant card with a shared `urls` asset, e.g. a shared vocoder,
    must revisit this). The branch is further gated on the platform's default
    download repo (`specs["repos"][0]`, already computed above) actually
    being one of the ONNX variant repos: on macOS/Apple Silicon, _base_specs
    swaps the download to the single MLX repo, which is never one of the
    ONNX variant_repos, so any-rung over them would report a permanently
    absent card even with the MLX repo fully cached. On that lane the branch
    is skipped and the normal _repos_cached(specs) check below correctly
    evaluates the MLX repo.

    llamacpp_* translate cards additionally need the shared llama-server binary
    installed for EVERY required flavor (see download() / llama_runtime.
    required_flavors) — the machine's default flavor AND the tiny cpu floor;
