"""Deployment planner: given a Machine and a catalog model, decide the ordered
list of Plans (best first, CPU floor last) — tier gating, quant/variant
picking, platform filtering. No hardware probing, no downloads, no model
loading, and NO runtime import of accel.py at all: every environment/I-O fact
this module needs — the current OS platform tag, the RTF/tps bench cache,
which quants are already downloaded locally, how to estimate a deployment's
VRAM footprint, and whether a compute-type's runtime is importable — arrives
as a plain parameter or an injected callable, supplied by whichever caller
already did that I/O. That makes every function here table-testable with
plain values; no monkeypatching required.

accel.py (the Loader) owns hardware probing, downloads, and model loading. It
imports this module at its own module scope and re-exposes `resolve`,
`resolve_translate`, `resolve_tts`, `select_variant`, `_llamacpp_variant_row`,
and `resolve_deployments` as thin Loader-wrapper functions of the same name
and public call signature the frozen characterisation suite and the engines
already depend on: each wrapper fetches its own I/O — calling
`current_platform()`/`bench_load()`/`probe()`/`_downloaded_quants()`/
`_est_bytes()`/`_format_ready()` as bare module-global names in accel.py, so
tests that do `monkeypatch.setattr(accel, "<name>", ...)` keep observing
them — and hands the results to the pure function here as parameters.
Dependency direction is strictly one-way: accel imports planner, planner
never imports accel."""

    Candidates are first narrowed to `runnable` compute_types — those with at
    least one deployment row whose tier is available on this machine (a cpu
    row is always tier-available, so any compute_type shipping a cpu row is
    always runnable). This narrowing happens BEFORE anything else, because a
    compute_type with no runnable row can never be loaded no matter how small
    its footprint or how eagerly the user downloaded it (e.g. an fp32+bf16
    ladder where only fp32 ships a cpu row: on a CPU-only machine bf16 would
    otherwise "win" the smallest-est_bytes fallback below and leave zero
    runnable deployments — the exact dead end this narrowing exists to avoid).

    An explicit device `override` narrows the variant choice further, to
    variants that can actually run on the device being pinned — using the
    SAME predicate `resolve_deployments` uses to pin rows (tier's device ==
    override, or override == 'cuda' matching any non-cpu tier). Without this,
    the narrowing above can hand back a compute_type that has no row at all
    on the overridden device (e.g. bf16 outranks fp32 on a CUDA machine, but
    bf16 ships no cpu row) — the model is then narrowed to bf16-only rows
    BEFORE the override ever gets a chance to pin anything, so the pin has
    nothing to attach to and is silently dropped: override='cpu' would still
    resolve to gpu-cuda. If the override-scoped runnable set is empty (the
    override names a device this model has no row for at all, e.g.
    override='dml' on a card with no dml deployments), fall back to the
    machine-wide runnable set exactly as when override is 'auto' — the
    override then has nothing to pin downstream regardless of which
    compute_type is chosen here, so this is a graceful no-op rather than a
    dead end.

    pin wins when it names a runnable (override-scoped, when applicable)
    compute_type; a pin naming an unrunnable (or unknown) compute_type is
    ignored and falls through to the rest of this function, rather than
    being honored into a dead end.

    Otherwise, restrict to `downloaded` variants that are also runnable, when
    that intersection is non-empty (we prefer to LOAD the repo the user
    DOWNLOADED); if the user downloaded only unrunnable variants, fall back to
    the full runnable set instead — the one exception to the
    load-what-you-downloaded rule, since a downloaded-but-unrunnable variant
    cannot be loaded anyway and recommending a runnable one is the honest
    behavior.

    From the surviving candidates, take the compute_type of the
    highest-rank candidate deployment whose own accelerator row is usable on
    this machine — deployments are walked in RANK order, not tuple
    declaration order, so a card whose rows happen to be declared fp32-before
    -bf16 still lands cuda machines on bf16 when bf16 outranks fp32 (Apple
    Silicon similarly lands on whichever runnable row ranks highest, e.g. the
    fp32 mlx row). With no usable accelerator row, the smallest candidate
    wins (CPU is bandwidth-bound: smaller = faster)."""
