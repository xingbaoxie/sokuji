"""Higgs Audio Tokenizer codec glue: reference-clip voice-cloning encode and
codes -> waveform decode, driving four of the seven sessions from
`runtime.build_sessions` (`acoustic_encoder`, `semantic_encoder`,
`quantizer_encoder`, `higgs_decoder` -- the COLD graphs). Torch-free -- numpy
+ `soxr` for resampling + `soundfile` to read the reference clip.

Ports the exact ONNX-pipeline logic from `.spike/models/repo/inference.py`'s
`higgs_encode`/`higgs_decode` (the same pipeline independently verified
end-to-end, including an eager-vs-ONNX numeric parity check against the
PyTorch HiggsAudioV2TokenizerModel, in
`scripts/reexport-omnivoice/tests/test_bidi_export.py::
test_higgs_export_roundtrip`: code_match=0.9838, wav_cos=0.9989 on
`scripts/assets/gpt-sovits-voices/classic-zh.wav`), with one API change:
`encode_reference` here drops the leading batch axis on its returned codes
(`(8, T)` instead of the spike's `(8, 1, T)`) since this backend only ever
encodes one reference clip at a time.

Pipeline (encode_reference):
  ref_audio @ 24 kHz -> acoustic_encoder -> acoustic_features (1, 256, Ta)
  ref_audio @ 16 kHz -> semantic_encoder -> semantic_features (1, 768, Ts)
  T = min(Ta, Ts); truncate BOTH streams to T (split-graph contract -- the
    two encoders are independent conv stacks over different sample rates
    and can disagree by a frame or two on non-multiple clip lengths)
  acoustic_features[:, :, :T] + semantic_features[:, :, :T]
    -> quantizer_encoder -> codes (8, 1, T) int64 -> drop batch -> (8, T)

Pipeline (decode):
  codes (8, T) -> add batch axis -> (8, 1, T) -> higgs_decoder
    -> waveform_24k (1, 1, samples) -> squeeze -> (samples,) float32

    OmniVoice's non-autoregressive decode grows a reference-code PREFIX from the
    clip; past ~T=300 (~12 s) the decode intermittently collapses/garbles, so
    long clips must be capped. But the CUT MUST LAND ON A PAUSE: a hard cut
    mid-word leaves the reference codes ending in half a phoneme, and the model
    "completes" that cut sound at the start of every generated chunk — an
    audible "eh"-like grunt (ASR literally transcribed the artifacts: "Day.",
    "fair.", "Say," prepended to sentences when a 6.5 s clip was hard-cut at
    3 s). A clean clip UNDER the cap passes through whole and clones at preset
    quality (the 6.5 s sarah preset == importing sarah uncut).

    The reference must END IN SILENCE: generation continues right after the
    reference codes, and a reference that ends in active speech makes the model
    "finish" that speech first — a short blip at the start of EVERY generated
    chunk (measured: 30-40 milli-RMS leading transients on import vs 0-1 for
    the untrimmed preset whose tail silence survived). So the trailing trim
    keeps ~0.25 s of the clip's natural decay/room tone, and if the clip still
    ends hot (e.g. a no-pause hard cap), literal silence is appended.

    Steps: (1) trim leading/trailing near-silence (20 ms frames below 6% of
    peak frame energy), keeping ~0.25 s of natural tail, (2) cap to
    `max_seconds`, cutting at the last low-energy frame in the second half of
    the cap window (hard cut only if the clip has no pause there),
    (3) peak-normalize to 0.95 (a quiet recording otherwise clones to
    near-inaudible output), (4) append silence if the tail is still hot.
    Returns 1-D float32.
