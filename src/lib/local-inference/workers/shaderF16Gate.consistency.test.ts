/**
 * Every worker that can load an f16 variant on WebGPU must call the gate.
 *
 * The gate first shipped covering seven workers and missed three more that also
 * hand a dtype to a WebGPU loader — Qwen3.5, HY-MT and TranslateGemma, each with
 * a `q4f16` variant in the manifest. Hand-enumerating the workers is what
 * failed, so this enumerates them from disk: a new WebGPU worker cannot be added
 * without either wiring the gate or naming itself below with a reason.
 *
 * The predicate is deliberately loose (mentions WebGPU AND loads a model) and
 * the exemptions carry the judgement, because the three shapes a worker uses to
 * reach the GPU — `device: 'webgpu'`, `executionProviders: ['webgpu']`, and a
 * computed `device` variable — are exactly what a tighter pattern kept missing.
