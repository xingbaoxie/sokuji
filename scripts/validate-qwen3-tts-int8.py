"""int8 quality gate: synthesize fixed zh/en sentences with the int8 tree via
the real Qwen3TtsOnnxBackend (cpu) and transcribe with the sidecar's own ASR
engine (loopback); compare against the fp32 tree run the same way. PASS =
int8 transcripts match the fp32 transcripts (same normalized text), no
empty/near-silent output, and CPU RTF(int8) < RTF(fp32) (WARN only if not).

Adapted from the Task-2 brief's harness sketch to the REAL APIs in this repo,
plus two rounds of empirical correction (see git log for scripts/ and
task-2-report.md for the full trace):

  - AsrEngine (sidecar/sokuji_sidecar/asr_engine.py) has no standalone
    transcribe(wav) method. Live audio goes through feed()/flush(), which
    segment via a silero VAD and call `self._backend.transcribe(samples,
    language)` once per detected segment (see AsrEngine._drain). A
    synthesized clip is already one clean, pre-isolated utterance with no
    unknown speech boundaries to find, so this harness calls the *resolved*
    backend directly -- the exact same transcribe() call the engine makes
    internally, using the same accel.resolve()-driven load path (AsrEngine.
    init()), just without the VAD chunker that exists for live/streaming
    input. That also removes VAD boundary jitter as a source of transcript
    drift unrelated to the fp32-vs-int8 comparison this gate exists for.

  - Qwen3TtsOnnxBackend.generate() *can* run in a no-voice-clone mode
    (voice_clone_prompt=None -- see qwen3_tts/template.py's
    build_talker_inputs docstring) and does not raise, but empirically
    degrades badly (near-silent / filler-word output) rather than raising.
    This harness ALWAYS calls set_builtin_voice() -- unconditionally, not on
    an exception -- with the snapshot's first bundled voice (preferring one
    whose reference transcript .txt exists) after set_language(), so fp32
    and int8 get identical ICL/x-vector conditioning.

  - SOKUJI_QWEN3_TTS_GREEDY=1 (argmax decoding) was tried first for a
    numerically-tight A/B and turned out to degenerate this AR model: with
    no temperature/top-p escape hatch, greedy decoding gets stuck in a
    repetition loop that never selects EOS, running to the frame cap
    (max_new_tokens, default 600 @ ~12.5 codec Hz -> ~48s) regardless of the
    ~4s a short sentence should take. The resulting audio -- reproducibly
    (verified bit-exact across repeat fp32 runs, so this isn't run-to-run
    noise) -- transcribes to a stray filler word, not the input sentence,
    for BOTH variants. A garbled baseline can't judge int8. This harness
    only sets SOKUJI_QWEN3_TTS_SEED=42 (harness defaults to 42, caller may
    override) and leaves
    sampling stochastic (do_sample=True); comparison is over normalized
    ASR TEXT (semantic), not raw samples, so fp32 and int8 need not decode
    an identical token path or produce identical sample counts -- they only
    need to say the same thing.

  - Because a stochastic decode can still degenerate on either variant, this
    harness checks the fp32 BASELINE against the input sentence itself
    before trusting any fp32-vs-int8 comparison: `_content_words` extracts
    the input's meaningful words (or, for zh, individual CJK characters --
    there are no word boundaries to split on), and `_baseline_plausible`
    requires at least MIN_CONTENT_OVERLAP of them to appear in the fp32
    hypothesis. If the baseline itself doesn't resemble the input, this is
    a HARNESS ERROR (report BLOCKED with evidence), never a silent int8
    FAIL -- a broken reference can't validate anything compared against it.

  - The ASR loopback loads on device="auto", NOT "cpu" (the TTS backend
    still loads on "cpu" -- see synth() -- because the int8 comparison this
    gate exists for is specifically about the CPU-EP MatMulNBits graphs).
    Diagnosed directly against transcribe_cpp (bypassing AsrEngine
    entirely): cohere-transcribe-03-2026's CPU backend
    (libggml-cpu-armv8.6_2.so on this aarch64 box) has a genuine
    correctness bug -- session.run() on a *known-correct* reference clip
    (voices/Atlas.wav, whose .txt transcript is on record) returns "Oh,
    yeah." regardless of the actual audio content, while the vulkan and
    auto backends transcribe the identical PCM correctly and verbatim. This
    is a transcribe_cpp/cohere-model/CPU-backend bug on this machine,
    unrelated to Qwen3-TTS or its quantization; forcing the ASR loopback
    onto whatever `accel.resolve()` picks by default (usually vulkan here)
    avoids it corrupting every transcript in this gate.
